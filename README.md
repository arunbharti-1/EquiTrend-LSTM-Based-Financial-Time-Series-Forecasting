# 📈 EquiTrend-LSTM-Based-Financial-Time-Series-Forecasting

This project demonstrates the use of traditional time series models (ARIMA) and deep learning models (LSTM) for predicting stock prices. It integrates data preprocessing, model training, and deployment into a user-friendly Streamlit web application.

## ✨ Features

- **📊 Data Source**: Historical stock price data retrieved using the `yfinance` Python library.
- **🎯 Target Variable**: Closing prices of stocks in the S&P 500 index.
- **📂 Models**:
  - **ARIMA**: Traditional time series model for short-term forecasts.
  - **LSTM**: Deep learning model for capturing non-linear trends and long-term dependencies.
- **🌐 Web Interface**: Interactive Streamlit app for model visualization and comparison.

## 🔄 Project Workflow

### 1. 🛠️ Data Preprocessing
- Data normalized using `MinMaxScaler`.
- Sliding window of 60 days used to create input-output sequences for LSTM.
- Stationarity achieved using differencing for ARIMA.

### 2. 📘 Modeling Approaches
- **ARIMA**:
  - Hyperparameter selection via MINIC and ESACF methods.
  - Focused on short-term accuracy but struggled with non-linear patterns.
- **LSTM**:
  - Two LSTM layers with dense layers for output.
  - Used Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss.
  - Outperformed ARIMA in both short-term and long-term forecasting.

### 3. 🚀 Deployment
- Deployed on a Streamlit web app for interactive stock selection and prediction visualization.

## 🧩 Challenges and Solutions
- **ARIMA**:
  - Required data stationarity through extensive preprocessing.
  - Manual hyperparameter tuning using grid search and AIC.
- **LSTM**:
  - Overfitting resolved by adding dropout layers.
  - Computationally intensive, requiring significant hardware.

## 📊 Results
- **📈 Metrics**:
  - LSTM: MAE = 2.34, MSE = 8.92, R² = 0.87.
- LSTM outperformed ARIMA, excelling in capturing non-linear trends and volatility.
